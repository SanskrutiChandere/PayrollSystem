# PayrollSystem
Payroll System is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. It simulates payroll processing by managing employee details, salary calculations, and deductions in a structured and modular way.

🚀 OOP Concepts Used
✅ Encapsulation – Employee data and salary details are encapsulated within classes.
✅ Inheritance – Different types of employees (e.g., Full-time, Part-time) inherit from a base class.
✅ Polymorphism – Overridden methods for salary calculation based on employee type.
✅ Abstraction – Abstract classes and interfaces for payroll operations.
